# Linear Axis Control with PID

## Overview
This repository contains the resources and codebase for implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller on a linear axis. The project includes simulation models, MATLAB scripts, mechanical design files, Arduino code, and documentation including slides and a PDF report.

## Contents
- **Simulink Models**: Contains the simulation files for the PID control in Simulink.
- **MATLAB Scripts**: Includes MATLAB scripts used for designing and testing the PID controller.
- **Mechanical Files**: CAD files and other mechanical design documents for the linear axis.
- **Arduino Code**: Source code for the Arduino microcontroller to implement the PID control in real hardware.
- **Documentation**: Presentation slides and a detailed PDF report explaining the project's goals, design, and results.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need MATLAB, Simulink, and an Arduino IDE installed on your computer. Additionally, access to CAD software is necessary to view or modify the mechanical files.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ineso1/Linear-Axis-Control.git
```
2. Open the MATLAB scripts to understand the PID algorithm and simulation setup.
3. Load the Simulink model to simulate the PID control process for the linear axis.
4. Review the mechanical files to understand the physical setup required.
5. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino device following the setup described in the documentation.
6. Consult the PDF report and slides for a comprehensive overview of the project objectives, design considerations, and outcomes.

## Usage
This project is intended for educational purposes and as a reference for building a PID-controlled linear axis. The code and models provided can be used as a starting point for similar control system projects or adapted to fit specific requirements.
